#### notes
no data structs (list, dict, array are from libGee), only GList, struct and [].
however, libGee is implemented in Vala. check dova-core for tips on integrating my own no-g version of libGee
missing some string handling - regex based
no virtual or override
no interface
no abstract
no for..in Iterable requres GObject
subclasses, like derived structs, cannot declare instance members
limited generics - only primitive types except for builtins (List)
